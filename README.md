CuteDB
======

a key-vlaue database outperforms redisï¼Œhas a protocol compatible with redis. Recently it can be seen as Just A Java Version of Redis.

Though it's written in java, CuteDB does outperform redis which is written in C under some cirumstances. 

The main reason i guess is the CuterServer which is a light-weight event-driven server framework that leverage Disruptor.

Have fun playing with it!
